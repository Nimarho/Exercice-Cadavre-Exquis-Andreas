# The Epic of Conan
I grew up in the Hiberian Age.
Once 6 years old I could wield a Hammer.
And my father tought me the secret of steel.

My dream was always to be a warrior, to travel onto the sea and discover new lands. So I studied with my father the secrets of steel he told me, and when I was 12 years old, I forged my first axe. Since then, I work had at the village to have enough gold to buy a Drakkar. It was a pretty hard work, I was working on the field, but I was well paid. 

One day, i woke up, ate my beakfast and went to work. This day i was working with a big sickle to cut all the dead grass in the field. It was my first time with this tool so I was a bit lost and very slow. My boss went to me to say that I need to work quicker so I tried but unfortunatly I slipped and cut my hand. I was shocked to see my hand on the ground with all the blood.
